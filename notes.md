#### course’s role in the program

Video & Audio Editing 2 dives deeper into cinematography and video editing, exploring further what was learned in previous semesters. Focus will be on engaging viewers and users, informing, entertaining and even moving audiences. Motion Graphics 2, in the following semester will further navigate these immersive waters.

#### COURSE OBJECTIVES & LEARNING ACTIVITIES

Students apply narrative techniques to communicate ideas or information using video, audio, and motion graphics :
• Develop a storyboard
• Use b-roll, close-ups, reaction shots to help develop the narrative
• Use camera motion techniques to develop the narrative
• Use light, set, costumes and props to support storytelling objectives and enhance user experience.
• Use a multi camera set up
• Use a multi mic set up
• Use cuts and/or transitions to develop the narrative
• Use audio elements such as soundtrack, ambient, and voice recording to develop the narrative

Students will be assessed using a combination of, but not limited to, the following:
• Individual and collaborative exercises.
• Individual and group projects designed to challenge and evaluate learning outcomes.
• Theoretical tests addressing the concepts discussed in class.

#### tentative schedule and evaluation

## deliverables

for the main projects, I propose the following deliverables

video 2 websites MUST be located at video2/

- Capyskills journal ([see details](https://582multi.media/capyskills/))
- project brainstorming & description (Figma)
- project plan including (as appropriate):
  - moodboard / storyboard / script
  - shot list / set plan / properties list
  - calendar / timeline

- draft version with feedback
- final version including: (dropped in shared OneDrive folder)
  - title sequence
  - credits for you / content creators
  - credits for any media / resources you used
- web page with:
  - title
  - description with challenge / client brief
  - optional: sharing process with storyboards / scripts etc
  - final work
  - summary with feedback / result etc

## background, looping video

shoot some video(s) edit & format for use as a background, looping video.

Your loop should smooth, so that the start & stop is not apparent. You can use a number of techniques but essetially the first and last frames should be identical (or nearly identical):

- a static scene with subjects entering / exit the scene
- perfectly repeating movement
- something that passes in front of the camera obscuring the background
- camera movement the hides the edit
- multiple scenes
- a combination of above

[loop example with html & css](https://nortonb.582multi.media/2024-25/video2/loop.html)

## proposed projects

here is what I suggest, but am open to your input

- background looping video(s) for your websites / portfolios
- an event video (like a live event)
- special collaborative project with first & third-year students
- an interview / interviews
- a personal project (story narrative)

## What do you want to do this semester?

My idea is that you shoot a lot of material and edit it. Many of you, it seems, have not shot much material since first semester. What do you think?

We have acquired some great new gear to make sharing your stories easier:

- 4 full-frame, mirroless cameras (2 Lumix s5iix & 2 s5ii)
- lights, lots of light & stands and stuff
- microphones and field recorders (3 sets of wireless lav mics, 2 lav mics, 3 field recorders [Zoom H1, H4N Pro, H5])
- 2 DJI phone gimbals, a bunch of phone holders / tripods

Also, I would like to focus on getting good sound for your videos. Ideally you will use microphones in the field to record ambient, voice and maybe even music. And use a DAW (digital audio workstation) such as Adobe Audition process your recordings.

## project 1: event

plan, shoot, edit and publish a video of an event

In addition to the standard deliverables you should also take into account the following:

- planning / shot list
- multiple cameras?
- multiple mics?
- establishing shot
- audience or participant reaction shots
- testimonial / interview (?)
- ambient sound

presentation due February 18 / 20

final due February 25 / 27

## project 1: event exercises

### 1.1 composition

edit together 6 shots focussing on composition including framing and lighting (natural or lit or hybrid). Upload to YouTube or Vimeo and embed on your page.

pages MUST be located at /video2/ (and as you know must be "index.html")

due February 4 / 6

### 1.2 audio

record 6 scenes with different types of audio, edit the audio

- ambient sounds with camera / phone mic, on-camera mic, other mic
- voice with camera / phone mic, on-camera mic, lav mic

you should edit your audio:

- remove problems (spectrum analyser)
- reduce noise (low & high pass??)
- normalize to -3db (voice) or -6db (ambient)

due February 4 / 6

### 1.3 b-roll

have some fun with slow motion, camera movement & lighting to create 6 short b-roll sequences

due February 11 / 13
